Create the constants (DONE)
Add coral placement tracker (PARTIALLY DONE)
Add algae counters/tracker (PARTIALLY DONE)
Add simple positions (preset points : less precise, easier to code)
Add basic "efficient step finder" 
Find a better name for the "efficient step finder"
Make the step finder more precise (kinda like a chess engine) (it makes sense I swear)

Maybe :
Add actual position (coordinates) and paths for said positions
